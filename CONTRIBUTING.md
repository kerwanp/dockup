# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute! üôè

**Working on your first Pull Request (PR)?** You can learn how from this free series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Open issues

Please check out the [the open issues](https://github.com/kerwanp/dockup/issues). Issues labelled [**Good First Issue**](https://github.com/kerwanp/dockup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are especially good to start with.

Contributing doesn‚Äôt have to be in code. Simply answering questions in open issues or providing workarounds is as important as making pull requests.

## New features

New features must always be discussed in a specific issue to ensure a correct implementation and avoid any future breaking changes.
