Under the hood services are simply Docker containers with pre-defined configurations and improved developer experience.

```ts title="dockup.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "dockup/config";
import { container } from "dockup/services";

export default defineConfig({
  services: [
    container({ name: "database", image: "postgres:latest" })
      .withEnv("POSTGRES_USER", "dockup")
      .withEnv("POSTGRES_DB", "dockup"),
  ],
});
```
