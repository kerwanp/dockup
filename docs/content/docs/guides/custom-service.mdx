Under the hood services are simply Docker containers with pre-defined configurations and improved developer experience.

```ts title="dockup.config.ts" twoslash
import { defineConfig } from "dockup/config";
import { container } from "dockup/services";

export default defineConfig({
  services: [
    container({
      name: "database",
      image: "postgres:latest",
      extend: (container) =>
        container.withEnv("POSTGRES_USER", "dockup").withPort(5432),
    }),
  ],
});
```
