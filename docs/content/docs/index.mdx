## Introduction

Dockup is a **CLI tool** for creating and managing development environments. You can run basically anything, Postgresql, Redis, MySQL, RabbitMQ, etc.

It has been built with a focus on developer experience, anyone can get started without any DevOps experience.

## Requirements

### Docker

Install Docker Desktop by following the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your platform:

- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/):
  - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/ubuntu/)
  - [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/debian/)
  - [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/fedora/)
  - [Arch](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/arch/)
  - [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/rhel/)

## Install

### Global (recommended)

Use your favorite package manager to install **Dockup** globally.

```package-install
npm i -g dockup
```

Then initialize **Dockup** inside your project, this will prompt what services you want to configure:

```bash
dockup init
```

You can now start your development environment:

```bash
dockup
```

### Remotely

Initialize **Dockup** inside your project, this will prompt what services you want to configure:

```package-install
npx dockup init
```

<Callout>

By using this method you will have to prefix every command and will make them slower depending on your package manager.

</Callout>

You can now start your development environment:

```bash
dockup
```
